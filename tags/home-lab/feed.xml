		&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve had a small home lab for a bit. Servers have come and gone, but a few core ones have remained. So let&amp;rsquo;s talk about it, and my home network as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;network&#34;&gt;Network&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s start with the network, as that&amp;rsquo;s the backbone of the everything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m pretty much all in on UNiFi for networking. My main router is a &lt;a href=&#34;https://ui.com/us/cloud-gateways/dream-router&#34;&gt;UNiFi Dream Router&lt;/a&gt;. The UDR is a home and small business router. With the usual built in switch (though two of the ports are POE), and wireless access point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The UDR, also controls two dedicated access points. One being a U6-LITE, and the other being an older AC-PRO. This allows me to have one, seamless, multi AP WiFi network. That covers the whole house. Though all of my lab server are hooked up over gigabit ethernet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;home-lab&#34;&gt;Home Lab&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My home lab, is made up of four main servers. My NAS, DNS, Home Auto, and Virtualization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;nas&#34;&gt;NAS&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My NAS is a &lt;a href=&#34;https://global.download.synology.com/download/Document/Hardware/DataSheet/DiskStation/18-year/DS418/enu/Synology_DS418_Data_Sheet_enu.pdf&#34;&gt;Synology DS418&lt;/a&gt;. Its an older four bay NAS. It&amp;rsquo;s main use is as file storage (duh), movie serving, and as a backup target for my Mac.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A NAS is so simple, it can be kinda hard to explain. Think of it like a giant flash drive. That any computer on the network can access. Provided they have a login. A NAS can also protect your data. If the drive in your computer dies, any data you backup to the NAS, will be safe. And even if a drive in the NAS dies, no data will be lost (if you have RAID set up correctly).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A NAS can also do fancy stuff, liking being the storage for a separate VM server. The VMs may get executed on one server, but all their files live elsewhere on the network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;dns&#34;&gt;DNS&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My DNS server is a Raspberry Pi 4 running &lt;a href=&#34;https://pi-hole.net&#34;&gt;Pi-Hole&lt;/a&gt;. Pi-Hole is a network wide ad blocking server. It&amp;rsquo;s one of those server, where you just set and forget. The only main thing about the set up, is that a number of guides tell you to set the Pi-Hole&amp;rsquo;s IP, as the DNS on each of you devices. This is quite simply, shit. And really screams &amp;ldquo;I don&amp;rsquo;t know networking&amp;rdquo;. What you really want to do. Is set the Pi-Hole&amp;rsquo;s IP as you DNS server, on your DHCP server&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; (usually that&amp;rsquo;s part of your router). That way, every device on your network, will automatically use the Pi-Hole.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Pi my Pi-Hole is running on, also has a USB to M.2 SATA board as its boot drive. I&amp;rsquo;ve had a number of SD cards and USB stick killed from Pi-Hole&amp;rsquo;s logging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;home-auto&#34;&gt;Home Auto&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My home automation server, is really more of a protocol translation server. I mainly use Apple HomeKit for everything. Automations, and manual setting of devices. The only issue is, I have a number of devices that won&amp;rsquo;t natively connect to HomeKit. Enter, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.home-assistant.io&#34;&gt;Home Assistant&lt;/a&gt;. Home Assistant manages all of my Z-Wave devices, passing their state to HomeKit. That&amp;rsquo;s really it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did use to use Home Assistant as my dedicated home auto server. But back then, Home Assistant wasn&amp;rsquo;t all that stable. It would work just happily for years, until it would shit the bed. While HomeKit is far less powerful, it&amp;rsquo;s also far more stable. That&amp;rsquo;s a trade off I&amp;rsquo;m fine with making.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My Home Assistant server runs on a Raspberry Pi 3+.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;virtualization&#34;&gt;Virtualization&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My virtualization server, is an old ass Dell OpitPlex running &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.proxmox.com/en/proxmox-virtual-environment/overview&#34;&gt;ProxMoX VE&lt;/a&gt;. The fact that it&amp;rsquo;s old doesn&amp;rsquo;t really bother me, as I only need one or two VMs running at a time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main perk of a VM server, is that it let&amp;rsquo;s you offload running a VM from your local machine. This is great if you just don&amp;rsquo;t want to tank your laptop battery. Or your main computer is an ARM system, like mine. In that case, you can&amp;rsquo;t easy run an x86 VM. So having a VM server fixes that downside of daily driving an ARM computer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a my newest server. So I&amp;rsquo;m still building a core use for it. But it has come in handy for demoing different linux tools students.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The VM server runs on a second gen Intel Core i7 4C/8T, with 16GB of ram.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like any home lab, this thing is always changing. Servers have come and gone. One of the old ones I used to run was a Raspberry Pi based Minecraft Java server. Might do a post on that one. I wonder what my lab / network will look like in a few years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn:1&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Make your you set it as your DHCP DNS address, and not the DNS that the router will try to use. Some ISPs won&amp;rsquo;t give you an IP unless you have the router set to their DNS, looking at you Comcast.&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
