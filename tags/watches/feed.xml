		&lt;p&gt;Jan 1, 2024&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the years, Iâ€™ve worn many, many different watches. Maybe a little too many. I was thinking of doing a big blog post going over all of them. But that would be really long. So Iâ€™m breaking it up into two parts. This is part one, just Smart Watches. Part two will be on my traditional watch collection. So letâ€™s get started.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;details&gt;&lt;summary&gt;Jump To Section&lt;/summary&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#pebble&#34;&gt;Pebble&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href=&#34;#pebble-steel&#34;&gt;Pebble Steel&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href=&#34;#pebble-time&#34;&gt;Pebble Time&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href=&#34;#pebble2&#34;&gt;Pebble 2&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href=&#34;#moto&#34;&gt;Some Moto Thing&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href=&#34;#back-to-pebble&#34;&gt;Back To Pebble&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href=&#34;#AWS2&#34;&gt;Apple Watch S2&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href=&#34;#AWS4&#34;&gt;Apple Watch S4&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href=&#34;#NSW&#34;&gt;Non Smart Watches&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href=&#34;#AWS7&#34;&gt;Apple Watch S7&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href=&#34;#AWU1&#34;&gt;Apple Watch Ultra 1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/details&gt;
&lt;p class=&#39;notice&#39;&gt; You can view a picture of the watch by clicking ðŸ“·, or watch a review from when that watch came out by clicking ðŸŽ¥&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&#39;pebble&#39;/&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;pebble-httpswwwandroidpolicecomwp-contentuploads201309nexusae0_pebbleblackwatchthreebuttonside_201309251030513jpg-httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvg0vuyyngeey-pebble&#34;&gt;Pebble &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.androidpolice.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/nexusae0_PebbleBlackWatchThreeButtonSide_201309251030513.jpg&#34;&gt;ðŸ“·&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0VUYyNgEEY&#34;&gt;ðŸŽ¥&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;#pebble&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was my first watch. Not just my first smart watch, but my first watch. I didn&amp;rsquo;t participate in the kick starter, but I did put a pre order in on their site. I ended up canceling my pre order, and just buying one at a Best Buy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Pebble got so much right out of the gate. You had notification, watch apps, custom watch faces, 5-7 day battery life, and an always on display. That display was only black and white, no grey scale. But it worked, and was insanely readable in direct sunlight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Pebble was pretty fantastic, the only downside was how plasticky it was.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&#39;pebble-steel&#39;/&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;pebble-steel-httpbrain-imagescdndixonscom7210078727u_10078727jpg-httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvsf2etuli6uc-pebble-steel&#34;&gt;Pebble Steel &lt;a href=&#34;http://brain-images.cdn.dixons.com/7/2/10078727/u_10078727.jpg&#34;&gt;ðŸ“·&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sf2EtulI6uc&#34;&gt;ðŸŽ¥&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;#pebble-steel&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Pebble Steel fixed that one main issue. It was made out of stainless steel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&#39;pebble-time&#39;/&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;pebble-time-httpscdn1vox-cdncomthumbor9podxr3jzagjvfvyrc_lry0qjwicdn0vox-cdncomuploadschorus_assetfile3439584pebble_watch_3up0png-httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvvxsuqspbyto-pebble-time&#34;&gt;Pebble Time &lt;a href=&#34;https://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9POdXR3jzAgJvFVYrC_LrY0QJwI=/cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3439584/Pebble_Watch_3Up.0.png&#34;&gt;ðŸ“·&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXSUQSpBYTo&#34;&gt;ðŸŽ¥&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;#pebble-time&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Time brought new features to the Pebble. The big one, a color screen. That fancy color screen, didn&amp;rsquo;t hurt the battery life. Still perfectly viable in sunlight, and with the same 5-7 days battery life. The Time also had a microphone, so you could dictate messages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&#39;pebble2&#39;/&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;pebble-2-httpswwwbhphotovideocomimagesimages2000x2000pebble_100200064_2_heart_rate_smartwatch_1276995jpg-httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvuu1jn-ax5fg-pebble2&#34;&gt;Pebble 2 &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.bhphotovideo.com/images/images2000x2000/pebble_100200064_2_heart_rate_smartwatch_1276995.jpg&#34;&gt;ðŸ“·&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uu1jN-AX5Fg&#34;&gt;ðŸŽ¥&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;#pebble2&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had the first Pebble, and I was going to have the last. The Pebble 2 was a refined Pebble. It had the same black and white screen, but with the improvements of the Time. Extra storage, and that microphone. The 2 was a fantastic smart watch. But with the death of pebble, I knew I had to start looking for a replacement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&#39;moto&#39;/&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;some-moto-thing-moto&#34;&gt;Some Moto thing &lt;a href=&#34;#moto&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that Pebble was dead, I knew I wasn&amp;rsquo;t going to be able to keep using mine forever. While walking through a Best Buy, I noticed an open box Moto watch (I don&amp;rsquo;t remember what model it was). I used it for about three days before returning it. The round screen was cool, but Android Wear was not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&#39;back-to-pebble&#39;/&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;back-to-pebble-back-to-pebble&#34;&gt;Back to Pebble &lt;a href=&#34;#back-to-pebble&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not long after returning the Moto watch, Fitbit (the buyer of Pebble), announced they were going to keep the Pebble servers up for a year. This bought me plenty of time to think. Think of where I was going to go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&#39;AWS2&#39;/&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;apple-watch-s2-httpswwwnetonnetsegetfileproductimageprimarytillbehorforbrukningtelefongpstillmobilensmartwatchaktivitetsarmbandapple-watch-s2-42mm-grayaluminium237166_255120_1_normal_extrajpg-httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvauiei4hrxdy-aws2&#34;&gt;Apple Watch S2 &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.netonnet.se/GetFile/ProductImagePrimary/tillbehorforbrukning/telefongps/tillmobilen/smartwatchaktivitetsarmband/apple-watch-s2-42mm-grayaluminium(237166)_255120_1_Normal_Extra.jpg&#34;&gt;ðŸ“·&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aUIEi4HrXDY&#34;&gt;ðŸŽ¥&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;#AWS2&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the death of pebble, and my dislike of Android Wear at the time. I was still keeping my eyes open. I didn&amp;rsquo;t really like the Apple Watch, as it had some software issues, and wasn&amp;rsquo;t water resistant. That changed when Apple announced the Series 2. The S2 brought the performance up, and added water resistance. exactly what I was looking for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Going from a Pebble to an Apple Watch was pretty interesting. I could now take phone calls, send iMessages, use Siri. all on a bright color touch screen. It did take a bit to get used to charging every night, and not having an always on display. But it was nice to have a heart rate sensor that didn&amp;rsquo;t feel like a drill bit&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&#39;AWS4&#39;/&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;apple-watch-s4-httpsd1f7geppf3ca7cloudfrontnetorigin3826141573050513713_1536838547_1434890jpg-httpswwwyoutubecomwatchv0nr0v1yqhimt422sppyguuzgv0cm9pdgjvcmcgu2vyawvzidq3d-aws4&#34;&gt;Apple Watch S4 &lt;a href=&#34;https://d1f7geppf3ca7.cloudfront.net/origin/382614/1573050513713_1536838547_1434890.jpg&#34;&gt;ðŸ“·&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0NR0V1yQhIM&amp;amp;t=422s&amp;amp;pp=ygUUZGV0cm9pdGJvcmcgU2VyaWVzIDQ%3D&#34;&gt;ðŸŽ¥&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;#AWS4&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Series 4 was a good leap from the 2. Larger rounded screen, better performance, and LTE support. Yes I know, LTE got added in the Series 3, but this was my first time with the feature. I thought it was kinda cool when I got it, but fell in love with the feature at a water park. I was able to keep my phone in a locker, and still stay connected to the group I was with. After that, I was sold, and have had it on every Apple Watch since.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&#39;NSW&#39;/&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;non-smart-watches-nsw&#34;&gt;Non Smart Watches &lt;a href=&#34;#NSW&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was kinda fed up with smart watches at this point. The daily charging of Apple Watch, and some software annoyances were really getting to me. So I decided to stop using a smart watch, and pick up a traditional watch. This is were part 2 will come in, when I write it. I&amp;rsquo;ll link it here when I post it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&#39;AWS7&#39;/&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;apple-watch-s7-httpswwwtioplfotoprodukt_big1041mm_cellular_polnoc_22jpg-httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvbsosqkfa2l8ppygubyxbwbgugd2f0y2ggc2vyawvzidcgcmv2awv3-aws7&#34;&gt;Apple Watch S7 &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.tio.pl/foto/produkt_big/10/41mm_cellular_polnoc_2(2).jpg&#34;&gt;ðŸ“·&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BsosQkfa2L8&amp;amp;pp=ygUbYXBwbGUgd2F0Y2ggc2VyaWVzIDcgcmV2aWV3&#34;&gt;ðŸŽ¥&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;#AWS7&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a couple years on traditional watches, I was starting get a little board of them. So I pulled out my old Apple Watch S4 to see if the newer software fixed my complaints. In short, it did. But, If I was going back to a smart watch, it had to have an always on display.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I traded in my Series 4, and picked up a Series 7.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The S7 brought me the additions from the S5 and 6 that I skipped. Mainly the blood oxygen sensor, and the always on display. Man did I like the AOD. The S7 also had a slightly larger display, compared to the S4.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&#39;AWU1&#39;/&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;apple-watch-ultra-1-httpsfdn2gsmarenacomvvpicsappleapple-watch-ultra-1jpg-httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvhjeqowjtkhe-awu1&#34;&gt;Apple Watch Ultra 1 &lt;a href=&#34;https://fdn2.gsmarena.com/vv/pics/apple/apple-watch-ultra-1.jpg&#34;&gt;ðŸ“·&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjEqOWjTkHE&#34;&gt;ðŸŽ¥&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;#AWU1&#34;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is my current daily driver. I originally wasnâ€™t sold on it, but after getting a deep scratch on my S7â€™s display, I picked one up. I was originally just going to get a stainless steel Apple Watch, as that had a sapphire crystal. But the Ultra also came with one, and was the same price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was loving that battery life right off the bat. Only having to charge every two and a half days was a big relief. Still wasnâ€™t sold on the design. That was until I smacked it in the steel trailer tongue. The watch was fine. After that, I was sold, this thing is built like a tank.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So yeah, I&amp;rsquo;ve had a lot of watches. And that was only the smart watches. It&amp;rsquo;s been fun watching the market grow. And it&amp;rsquo;ll be interesting to see where the wearable goes.&lt;/p&gt;
