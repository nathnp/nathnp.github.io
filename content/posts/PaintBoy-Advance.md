# PaintBoy advance

I'm not new to modded gameboys. I've put IPS screens in a DMG and an SP, and I built an [all metal gameboy advance](https://fosstodon.org/@Sulairris/106783968641330983). Ive gotten the itch to build a custom GBA again after working on my girlfriend's GBA, I just need an ideaâ€¦

This is what I'm thinking. This is made from painting the inside of a clear shell, allowing the supports to still be seen. This isn't mine it's a screenshot from [this YouTube vid](https://youtu.be/XF_DDf9N1hc). I'm not going to build the full thing yet, just see if I can make the shell myself.

I ordered a clear replacement shell that's been pre-modded to take an IPS display, just need to buy some spray paint.

Many days later thanks to USPS, the shell came in the mail. It's a clear retrosix shell and its one of the better ones I've seen

The next thing I needed was some spray paint, so I grabbed my super gameboy, jumped in my car and headed up to the home depot. After looking over the spray paint aisle, they didn't really have what I was looking for, but I got something close. Oddly, [my home state](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Btv1OD_CUAAICrF?format=jpg&name=medium) Maryalnd requires you to be at least 18 to buy spray paint. Good thing i'm 25.

This is really my first time spray painting anything, but I have watched some modding vids that go over it. After taping up the outside, cracking the garage door, I got to work. I put down one layer, then another, then another, and waited. After peeling the tape off, it came out pretty good. Some over spray on the edges, but for a first time ensnarement, it went pretty well. I'll build something in this down the line.
