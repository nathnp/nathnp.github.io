For the past month, I've been running analytics on both of my websites. The service I've been using for this is [Plausible.io](https://plausible.io/). I went with them for a couple of reasons. Mainly, they didn't look hungry for personal data. I've been enjoying them quite a lot. They have a good, very easy to use interface. That's also not over whelming. But, I'm going to be turning analytics off, at least for now.

## Why I started

I started using analytics to simply see how many people were going to my site. As well as from what countries. The UK, Poland, Romania, and Czechia, are just a few that have visited my main site. That's what I've been enjoying the most.

## Why I'm stopping, for now

Price. That's it really. I have enjoyed Plausible, and still really like them. However I'm coming up on the end of my free month. And will have to start paying $9/month. Now, I could switch to a different analytics provider. But, I'm not big on a lot of the others I've looked at. I don't want to be one of those sites, that vacuums up every possible bit of user data.

I do plan on firing analytics back up down the line though. Plausible is open source, and you can host it yourself. Something I will do at some point. (You can even run it on a Pi with some work).

So yeah. Plausible has been good and I like it. But it's not really worth $9/month to have them host it. At least for me.
