With the closing down of third party Reddit apps, a number of people are moving over to things like kbin. And that has me wondering, are the new users of kbin, going to try and turn it into Reddit. 

This is something I’ve noticed over on Mastodon. When a large number a of new Mastodon users signed up, they very quickly started pushing for some new features. Those “new” features were just things that Twitter had, that Mastodon didn’t. It didn’t feel like they wanted to improve the Mastodon network. It felt like they wanted to turn it into what **they** were used to, instead of getting used to Mastodon. 

We’ll see if this happens with kbin and other like it.
