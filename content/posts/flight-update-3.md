I am now on my way from RDU to DEN. <br>
After everyone getting off at RDU (all but 16), and a headcount was taken, we were able to move seats. I moved from the very back, to the very front. Hoping to make a speedy exit at DEN.

I mentioned at the end of my last post, that my in flight entertainment is a bunch of plane crash documentaries. I downloaded 16 20 - 40 min videos by Green Dot Aviation (fantastic channel). To help make sure the person next to me doesn't get nervous, I have the videos playing in the mini player in the corner on my mac.

First one I watched was about UPS flight 6, a cargo aircraft that had a cargo fire. <br>
The second one was Swissair flight 111, a flight that had a fire. <br>
The third was about BA 162, a flight that caught... fire...

No, not all of them are about fires, here's all the ones I downloaded

I won't be able to post this till a fair bit after I get off the plane[^1], but this post was written on the plane, and will be date stamped of when I completed it, not when I post it[^2].

P.S. Noise canceling headphones are not only great for plane noise, but kid noise as well.
