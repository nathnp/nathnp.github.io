I'm Nathan, I'm a computer nerd who loves to travel, and do many other things.

This is my blog. I mostly use this place as a place to post longer form content. Mostly of me rambling off about something.
Posts here will mostly be about things Iâ€™m interested in, or whatever is on my mind.

<details>
	Mastodon is a different kind of social network. Instead of one big website, it's made up of many smaller communities, called 'servers.' You can choose the server that suits you best, follow people from other servers, and talk to them. It's like having your own corner of the internet where you can make friends and share ideas.[^2] You can learn more here [joinmastodon.org](https://joinmastodon.org).
