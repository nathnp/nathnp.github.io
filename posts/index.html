    <h2><a href="/posts/stealth-flipper/">Stealth Flipper</a></h2>
    Being More Stealthy With A Flipper Let&rsquo;s be honest, most flipper users use the flipper to dick around. You know, pop Tesla charge covers, set off CVS alcohol announcements (Bonus points if you do it in a state CVS can&rsquo;t sell alcohol in (Like Maryland)). You know, fun stuff. The Flipper is unfortunately recognizable (Thanks to dumpsters like TikTok). So, if we&rsquo;re going to have some fun in a CVS, or a Tesla store, we need to be a bit sneaky.
  
    <h2><a href="/posts/turning-off-analytics/">Turning Off Analytics For Now</a></h2>
    For the past month, I&rsquo;ve been running analytics on both of my websites. The service I&rsquo;ve been using for this is Plausible.io. I went with them for a couple of reasons. Mainly, they didn&rsquo;t look hungry for personal data. I&rsquo;ve been enjoying them quite a lot. They have a good, very easy to use interface. That&rsquo;s also not over whelming. But, I&rsquo;m going to be turning analytics off, at least for now.
  
    <h2><a href="/posts/secret-guest-network/">The Secret Guest Network</a></h2>
    Imagine this, you have some people over, and they want the password to your WiFi. You trust them, but not “you can be on my network” trust them. So you give them the guest network login. They get mad and leave, and now you&rsquo;re down a couple friends. But what if you could have a hidden guest network, that looks just like your main one, maybe that would let you keep some friends.
  
    <h2><a href="/posts/need-to-immediately-replace/">The Need to Immediately Replace</a></h2>
    With the closing down of third party Reddit apps, a number of people are moving over to things like kbin. And that has me wondering, are the new users of kbin, going to try and turn it into Reddit.
This is something I’ve noticed over on Mastodon. When a large number a of new Mastodon users signed up, they very quickly started pushing for some new features. Those “new” features were just things that Twitter had, that Mastodon didn’t.
  
    <h2><a href="/posts/paintboy-advance/">PaintBoy Advance</a></h2>
    PaintBoy advance I&rsquo;m not new to modded gameboys. I&rsquo;ve put IPS screens in a DMG and an SP, and I built an all metal gameboy advance. Ive gotten the itch to build a custom GBA again after working on my girlfriend&rsquo;s GBA, I just need an idea…
This is what I&rsquo;m thinking. This is made from painting the inside of a clear shell, allowing the supports to still be seen. This isn&rsquo;t mine it&rsquo;s a screenshot from this YouTube vid.
