  <p>The time has come, time to take the oil out of my car, wash it, and toss it back in<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve never liked getting under my car. I don&rsquo;t have an issue with getting under cars, just mine. She&rsquo;s a low car, so I have to jack it up a fair big to squeeze myself under it, That&rsquo;s the part I don&rsquo;t like<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>.</p>
<h2>Removing of the oil</h2>
<hr>
<p>After getting under the car, and getting the drain plug out, she was pissing oil out. That part was easy, after remembering what size socket I needed. Getting the filter off, was a different story.</p>
<p>Moving over to the oil filter, I put my filter wrench on. And it wouldn&rsquo;t fully grab. No big deal, I&rsquo;ve had that before. After about ten minutes of banging the filter adapter on, it sill wouldn&rsquo;t grab&hellip; After getting out from under the car, I looked in the tool box, and realized something. The filter adapter I was trying to use, wasn&rsquo;t for my car. It was was for my old Civic. Oops.</p>
<p>Grabbing the right adapter, the filter came off real easy. Using the right tools really helps.</p>
<p>After getting the new filter on<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>, it was time for my favorite part under the car. Being done under the car.</p>
<h2>Adding of the oil</h2>
<hr>
<p>With the car off of the jack stand. I dumped some oil in. After putting most of the oil in, I went to start the car for a few seconds&hellip; It wouldn&rsquo;t start. Turns out, the key fob needs to be in the car. You know, where it has to be for the computer to start the car.</p>
<p>With the rest of the oil in, and the dip stick happy, I was done. Yay!</p>
<hr>
<p>I don&rsquo;t mind doing my own oil, it&rsquo;s cheeper, and doesn&rsquo;t take long. But man, I don&rsquo;t like working on low cars.</p>
<p>For anyone wondering what car I drive, she&rsquo;s a 2015 Honda Accord EX-L, with a 2.4L i-VTECH DOHC mated to a CVT. Super fun to drive.</p>
