  <p>It started with getting to the airport, and that meant getting up at 3AM</p>

<p>The airport was pretty quiet this morning. That made getting through TSA pretty quick. Though, at the entrance, the computer didn&rsquo;t like my mobile ID, and threw some alerts. The agent had me try my physical ID, and that was fine, so he let me go. Can&rsquo;t trust the MVA<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> for anything.</p>
<h3 id="the-food-journey">The Food Journey</h3>
<p>This started when I got off the people-mover at C where my gate was. I got up to the main food court, and looked at my options<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>. With nothing good in site, I checked a map. There was a Chick-Fil-A in B, sweet. I headed back downstairs to the people-mover, and headed off to B.</p>
<p>When I got to B, I headed up to the food court, excited for some good Chick-Fil-A breakfast&hellip; It was closed. Alright, most fast food places in airports open at 5AM, it was almost that time. So I whipped out my phone to double check and, it opens at 6AM&hellip; My flight boards at 6:20AM, that won&rsquo;t work.</p>
<p>I took the people-mover back to C and looked at my options. C had an Auntie Anne&rsquo;s, that&rsquo;ll work. After a long ass walk, I arrive at the pretzel place, and it was closed. This one opened at 10AM&hellip; What the hell is wrong with you DEN?</p>
<h3 id="the-flight">The Flight</h3>
<p>Theres not many people on this flight, around 100/147. That means that I was able to get a whole row to myself, yay!</p>

<p>I do love a connection, airports are cool, and I love to explore them. However, this is the worst kind of connection<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>, the kind where I don&rsquo;t get off the plane. I&rsquo;ll take a direct flight over these. With those, I know I won&rsquo;t get to explore a new airport. With this connection type, I&rsquo;m so close, but so far. I did however, get to move up to the very front of the plane, as you can see in the boarding pass pics.</p>
<h3 id="the-flight-1">The Flight</h3>
<p>This is a pretty short flight, about one hour in the air. To pass the time, I watched some plane crash documentaries, while working on this post.</p>
