  <h1>Turning Off Analytics For Now</h1><time datetime="2023-10-26T22:51:17-05:00">Oct 26, 2023</time>
  <hr>

  <p>For the past month, I&rsquo;ve been running analytics on both of my websites. The service I&rsquo;ve been using for this is <a href="https://plausible.io/">Plausible.io</a>. I went with them for a couple of reasons. Mainly, they didn&rsquo;t look hungry for personal data. I&rsquo;ve been enjoying them quite a lot. They have a good, very easy to use interface. That&rsquo;s also not over whelming. But, I&rsquo;m going to be turning analytics off, at least for now.</p>
<h2 id="why-i-started">Why I started</h2>
<p>I started using analytics to simply see how many people were going to my site. As well as from what countries. The UK, Poland, Romania, and Czechia, are just a few that have visited my main site. That&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;ve been enjoying the most.</p>
<h2 id="why-im-stopping-for-now">Why I&rsquo;m stopping, for now</h2>
<p>Price. That&rsquo;s it really. I have enjoyed Plausible, and still really like them. However I&rsquo;m coming up on the end of my free month. And will have to start paying $9/month. Now, I could switch to a different analytics provider. But, I&rsquo;m not big on a lot of the others I&rsquo;ve looked at. I don&rsquo;t want to be one of those sites, that vacuums up every possible bit of user data.</p>
<p>I do plan on firing analytics back up down the line though. Plausible is open source, and you can host it yourself. Something I will do at some point. (You can even run it on a Pi with some work).</p>
<p>So yeah. Plausible has been good and I like it. But it&rsquo;s not really worth $9/month to have them host it. At least for me.</p>
