  <h1>My Smart Watch Journey</h1>

  

  <p>Jan 1, 2024</p>
<p>Over the years, Iâ€™ve worn many, many different watches. Maybe a little too many. I was thinking of doing a big blog post going over all of them. But that would be really long. So Iâ€™m breaking it up into two parts. This is part one, just Smart Watches. Part two will be on my traditional watch collection. So letâ€™s get started.</p>
<details><summary>Jump To Section</summary>

<p class='notice'> You can view a picture of the watch by clicking ðŸ“·, or watch a review from when that watch came out by clicking ðŸŽ¥</p>
<div id='pebble'/>
<h1 id="pebble-httpswwwandroidpolicecomwp-contentuploads201309nexusae0_pebbleblackwatchthreebuttonside_201309251030513jpg-httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvg0vuyyngeey-pebble">Pebble <a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/nexusae0_PebbleBlackWatchThreeButtonSide_201309251030513.jpg">ðŸ“·</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0VUYyNgEEY">ðŸŽ¥</a> <a href="#pebble">ðŸ”—</a></h1>
<p>This was my first watch. Not just my first smart watch, but my first watch. I didn&rsquo;t participate in the kick starter, but I did put a pre order in on their site. I ended up canceling my pre order, and just buying one at a Best Buy.</p>
<p>The Pebble got so much right out of the gate. You had notification, watch apps, custom watch faces, 5-7 day battery life, and an always on display. That display was only black and white, no grey scale. But it worked, and was insanely readable in direct sunlight.</p>
<p>The Pebble was pretty fantastic, the only downside was how plasticky it was.</p>
<div id='pebble-steel'/>
<h1 id="pebble-steel-httpbrain-imagescdndixonscom7210078727u_10078727jpg-httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvsf2etuli6uc-pebble-steel">Pebble Steel <a href="http://brain-images.cdn.dixons.com/7/2/10078727/u_10078727.jpg">ðŸ“·</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sf2EtulI6uc">ðŸŽ¥</a> <a href="#pebble-steel">ðŸ”—</a></h1>
<p>The Pebble Steel fixed that one main issue. It was made out of stainless steel.</p>
<div id='pebble-time'/>
<h1 id="pebble-time-httpscdn1vox-cdncomthumbor9podxr3jzagjvfvyrc_lry0qjwicdn0vox-cdncomuploadschorus_assetfile3439584pebble_watch_3up0png-httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvvxsuqspbyto-pebble-time">Pebble Time <a href="https://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9POdXR3jzAgJvFVYrC_LrY0QJwI=/cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3439584/Pebble_Watch_3Up.0.png">ðŸ“·</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXSUQSpBYTo">ðŸŽ¥</a> <a href="#pebble-time">ðŸ”—</a></h1>
<p>The Time brought new features to the Pebble. The big one, a color screen. That fancy color screen, didn&rsquo;t hurt the battery life. Still perfectly viable in sunlight, and with the same 5-7 days battery life. The Time also had a microphone, so you could dictate messages.</p>
<div id='pebble2'/>
<h1 id="pebble-2-httpswwwbhphotovideocomimagesimages2000x2000pebble_100200064_2_heart_rate_smartwatch_1276995jpg-httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvuu1jn-ax5fg-pebble2">Pebble 2 <a href="https://www.bhphotovideo.com/images/images2000x2000/pebble_100200064_2_heart_rate_smartwatch_1276995.jpg">ðŸ“·</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uu1jN-AX5Fg">ðŸŽ¥</a> <a href="#pebble2">ðŸ”—</a></h1>
<p>I had the first Pebble, and I was going to have the last. The Pebble 2 was a refined Pebble. It had the same black and white screen, but with the improvements of the Time. Extra storage, and that microphone. The 2 was a fantastic smart watch. But with the death of pebble, I knew I had to start looking for a replacement.</p>
<div id='moto'/>
<h1 id="some-moto-thing-moto">Some Moto thing <a href="#moto">ðŸ”—</a></h1>
<p>Now that Pebble was dead, I knew I wasn&rsquo;t going to be able to keep using mine forever. While walking through a Best Buy, I noticed an open box Moto watch (I don&rsquo;t remember what model it was). I used it for about three days before returning it. The round screen was cool, but Android Wear was not.</p>
<div id='back-to-pebble'/>
<h1 id="back-to-pebble-back-to-pebble">Back to Pebble <a href="#back-to-pebble">ðŸ”—</a></h1>
<p>Not long after returning the Moto watch, Fitbit (the buyer of Pebble), announced they were going to keep the Pebble servers up for a year. This bought me plenty of time to think. Think of where I was going to go.</p>
<div id='AWS2'/>
<h1 id="apple-watch-s2-httpswwwnetonnetsegetfileproductimageprimarytillbehorforbrukningtelefongpstillmobilensmartwatchaktivitetsarmbandapple-watch-s2-42mm-grayaluminium237166_255120_1_normal_extrajpg-httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvauiei4hrxdy-aws2">Apple Watch S2 <a href="https://www.netonnet.se/GetFile/ProductImagePrimary/tillbehorforbrukning/telefongps/tillmobilen/smartwatchaktivitetsarmband/apple-watch-s2-42mm-grayaluminium(237166)_255120_1_Normal_Extra.jpg">ðŸ“·</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aUIEi4HrXDY">ðŸŽ¥</a> <a href="#AWS2">ðŸ”—</a></h1>
<p>With the death of pebble, and my dislike of Android Wear at the time. I was still keeping my eyes open. I didn&rsquo;t really like the Apple Watch, as it had some software issues, and wasn&rsquo;t water resistant. That changed when Apple announced the Series 2. The S2 brought the performance up, and added water resistance. exactly what I was looking for.</p>
<p>Going from a Pebble to an Apple Watch was pretty interesting. I could now take phone calls, send iMessages, use Siri. all on a bright color touch screen. It did take a bit to get used to charging every night, and not having an always on display. But it was nice to have a heart rate sensor that didn&rsquo;t feel like a drill bit<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>.</p>
<div id='AWS4'/>
<h1 id="apple-watch-s4-httpsd1f7geppf3ca7cloudfrontnetorigin3826141573050513713_1536838547_1434890jpg-httpswwwyoutubecomwatchv0nr0v1yqhimt422sppyguuzgv0cm9pdgjvcmcgu2vyawvzidq3d-aws4">Apple Watch S4 <a href="https://d1f7geppf3ca7.cloudfront.net/origin/382614/1573050513713_1536838547_1434890.jpg">ðŸ“·</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0NR0V1yQhIM&amp;t=422s&amp;pp=ygUUZGV0cm9pdGJvcmcgU2VyaWVzIDQ%3D">ðŸŽ¥</a> <a href="#AWS4">ðŸ”—</a></h1>
<p>The Series 4 was a good leap from the 2. Larger rounded screen, better performance, and LTE support. Yes I know, LTE got added in the Series 3, but this was my first time with the feature. I thought it was kinda cool when I got it, but fell in love with the feature at a water park. I was able to keep my phone in a locker, and still stay connected to the group I was with. After that, I was sold, and have had it on every Apple Watch since.</p>
<div id='NSW'/>
<h1 id="non-smart-watches-nsw">Non Smart Watches <a href="#NSW">ðŸ”—</a></h1>
<p>I was kinda fed up with smart watches at this point. The daily charging of Apple Watch, and some software annoyances were really getting to me. So I decided to stop using a smart watch, and pick up a traditional watch. This is were part 2 comes in. You can read that <a href="/posts/my-regular-watches/">here</a></p>
<div id='AWS7'/>
<h1 id="apple-watch-s7-httpswwwtioplfotoprodukt_big1041mm_cellular_polnoc_22jpg-httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvbsosqkfa2l8ppygubyxbwbgugd2f0y2ggc2vyawvzidcgcmv2awv3-aws7">Apple Watch S7 <a href="https://www.tio.pl/foto/produkt_big/10/41mm_cellular_polnoc_2(2).jpg">ðŸ“·</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BsosQkfa2L8&amp;pp=ygUbYXBwbGUgd2F0Y2ggc2VyaWVzIDcgcmV2aWV3">ðŸŽ¥</a> <a href="#AWS7">ðŸ”—</a></h1>
<p>After a couple years on traditional watches, I was starting get a little board of them. So I pulled out my old Apple Watch S4 to see if the newer software fixed my complaints. In short, it did. But, If I was going back to a smart watch, it had to have an always on display.</p>
<p>So I traded in my Series 4, and picked up a Series 7.</p>
<p>The S7 brought me the additions from the S5 and 6 that I skipped. Mainly the blood oxygen sensor, and the always on display. Man did I like the AOD. The S7 also had a slightly larger display, compared to the S4.</p>
<div id='AWU1'/>
<h1 id="apple-watch-ultra-1-httpsfdn2gsmarenacomvvpicsappleapple-watch-ultra-1jpg-httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvhjeqowjtkhe-awu1">Apple Watch Ultra 1 <a href="https://fdn2.gsmarena.com/vv/pics/apple/apple-watch-ultra-1.jpg">ðŸ“·</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjEqOWjTkHE">ðŸŽ¥</a> <a href="#AWU1">ðŸ”—</a></h1>
<p>This is my current daily driver. I originally wasnâ€™t sold on it, but after getting a deep scratch on my S7â€™s display, I picked one up. I was originally just going to get a stainless steel Apple Watch, as that had a sapphire crystal. But the Ultra also came with one, and was the same price.</p>
<p>I was loving that battery life right off the bat. Only having to charge every two and a half days was a big relief. Still wasnâ€™t sold on the design. That was until I smacked it in the steel trailer tongue. The watch was fine. After that, I was sold, this thing is built like a tank.</p>
<hr>
<p>So yeah, I&rsquo;ve had a lot of watches. And that was only the smart watches. It&rsquo;s been fun watching the market grow. And it&rsquo;ll be interesting to see where the wearable goes.</p>
