  <h1>Deck OLED</h1>

  

  <p>Dec 4, 2023</p>
<p>A little while back, I upgraded my Deck. No, not the wooden thing on the <a href="https://i.pinimg.com/originals/39/10/c1/3910c1cfeca4d66d3d1d403ee74940bf.gif">back of a house</a>. I&rsquo;m talking about the Steam Deck.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had a Steam Deck for a little over a year. And over that year, the deck has gone from really cool, but needs to work. To&hellip; <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Om8iSXUAKh0">well&hellip;</a> Needless to say, I really like the Deck, and even upgraded mine to 2TB of storage. So when Valve announced the Deck OLED, I didn&rsquo;t want one.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t get me wrong, it looked cool as hell. And would love to have one. My first thought, was simply to build an upgrade kit from parts. Pick up a new shell, and the OLED panel (once it hit iFixit), and boom, kinda Deck OLED&hellip; Valve said no. The parts are not inter-compatible. So I bought one.</p>
<p>Yeah, I caved. And I don&rsquo;t regret it. The main big upgrade (being the OLED screen), is fantastic. But, there are a number of other smaller upgrades.</p>

<p>Ok, not really on that last one</p>
</center>
<p>One of the most noticeable improvements, is the build quality. The Deck LCD wasn&rsquo;t built poorly, but the OLED is just more sturdy.</p>
<p>The shrunk down APU, combined with the OLED screen, and the bigger battery, do wonders for battery life.</p>
<p>I could go on for a bit on all of the little changes, but channels like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pBQ4dosuT0&amp;pp=ygUNbHR0IGRlY2sgb2xlZA%3D%3D">LTT</a>, already <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCVXqoVi6RE&amp;pp=ygUNbHR0IGRlY2sgb2xlZA%3D%3D">have</a>.</p>
<h2 id="1tb-is-not-enough">1TB Is Not Enough</h2>
<p>1TB is plenty for a handheld, but I had a 2TB SSD, and I wanted to move it over.</p>
<p>I started with cracking my LCD open, and <a href="https://youtu.be/R0S8JZ6YO5c?si=Kv9rVkjzSWNLzfRY&amp;t=23">extracting</a> the 2TB SSD. After making sure all my non cloud synced stuff was backed up, I gave it a quick format. I then moved to the OLED. Cracking that open was much nicer. The OLED uses Torx screws, vs Philips. This is great, as Torx screws don&rsquo;t <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cam_out">cam out</a>. With the blank 2TB SSD in the OLED, and the old 1TB SSD in an external enclosure. I was ready. I popped a clonezilla boot disk into the SD card slot, and fired it up.</p>
<p>Clonezilla on the Deck is super easy to use. You can set up the whole operation with just the D-pad, and the A button&hellip; You just can&rsquo;t start the clone. Clonezilla is really adamant that you press <kbd>Y</kbd> to start the clone&hellip; So you need to plug in a keyboard, to press one key&hellip; Great.</p>
<p>About 40 minutes into the clone. I decided to move the deck to a more powerful power adapter&hellip; The moment I unplugged the cable, my docking adapter, blinked&hellip; Causing clonezilla to shit itself, as the source SSD dropped off&hellip; Now I had to start over.</p>
<p>Once the second clone attempt was done, I fired up the Deck. After waiting for SteamOS to auto expand the partition, it was done. A 2TB handheld, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpDL2l-MWEU">in the palm of my hand</a>.</p>
<h2 id="thoughts">Thoughts</h2>
<p>Overall, the Deck OLED is a fantastic upgrade, and I&rsquo;m very happy with mine. The 90Hz screen is fantastic for Halo. And the HDR OLED, makes everything pop in ways the old Deck just couldn&rsquo;t. The Deck OLED is more than just a screen upgrade. And that, is what got me to pick one up.</p>
