  <h1>New New Site</h1>

<p>Welp, this was a pain.</p>
<p>Over the past few days, I have been working on moving my website. Why you might ask? Let&rsquo;s go over that.</p>
<p>For a while, I was hosting this site on <a href="https://blot.im">blot.im</a>. Blot basically takes a bunch of markdown files you send them, and turns them into a website. I was a big fan of this. Simple, easy, and flexible. However, I started running into problems.</p>
<p>When you send MD files to blot, blot will cache the files, and build a site out of them. Every now and then, that cache would get stuck. You could push new files, but they wouldn&rsquo;t appear on the visible site. The only way I had to force the cache to refresh, was to email the dev.</p>
<h2 id="moving-to-something-new">Moving to Something New</h2>
<p>After some thinking, I decided to go with a static site. I&rsquo;ll generate the site on my mac, then push it to a host. The first tool I tried out was <a href="https://www.11ty.dev">11ty</a> After a bunch of work, I got a super basic site up and running with <a href="https://www.11ty.dev">11ty</a> However, I didn&rsquo;t like it. <a href="https://www.11ty.dev">11ty</a> is written in Java Script, and I really don&rsquo;t like Java Script.</p>
<p>The next tool I tried was <a href="https://jekyllrb.com">Jekyll</a>. Jekyll looked way nicer to work with. There was just one tiny problem. Ruby 3.1.3 didn&rsquo;t want to compile on my mac. So that was out.</p>
<p>The tool that I went with (as you can see in the footer), is <a href="https://gohugo.io">Hugo</a>. Hugo, ships as a Go binary. This fixes the issue I had with Jekyll, and 11ty. Nothing to compile, and it&rsquo;s not Java Script. I&rsquo;m not going to go into how to use Hugo, as I&rsquo;m still learning it.</p>
<p>As for hosting, I&rsquo;m using <a href="https://pages.github.com">Github Pages</a>. All I have to do, is drop the built site into a folder. and push that to Github.</p>
<p>The best part of all of this. My hosting costs have gone from $4/month, to $0/month.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m still not done yet. The main thing remaining to to move all of my old posts over. That&rsquo;s going to take a bit. I&rsquo;ll get there though.</p>
