  <h1>The Time I Broke My Foot, and Didnâ€™t Know</h1><time datetime="2024-01-06T12:20:13-05:00">Jan 6, 2024</time>

  <p>It all happened while playing a game of manhunt<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>. This game was being played indoors, and I was running. Running away from an ambush. I was running back to the safe area, and I was running barefoot<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>. This, this is where I made a mistake.</p>
<p>I have loose joints. So when kicked someoneâ€™s boot at full speed. I thought I just popped some joints in my foot. I do that all the time, no big deal. So, thinking that, I kept playing. For the next half hour, I ran, and hunted man. I stopped when my foot inflated like a balloon. A purple balloon.</p>
<p>A trip to the doctor later, and I was in a boot, with a clean break in my third metatarsal. A simple clean break, just had to take it easy, and use the boot. However, thatâ€™s not all I did. After a trip to my uncles house<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup> (my normal doc). He took one look at my X-ray, and gave me some more news.</p>
<p>The clean break in my third metatarsal, explained the slight pain in the middle of my foot. But what about the pain on the outside of my foot. Turn out, I broke my fifth metatarsal as well. Though, I didnâ€™t do it cleanly. I partially shattered it. Yep, that explained the pain.</p>
<p>With all that, I was told one main thing. Donâ€™t ski for six weeks. This makes sense. The bones need time to heal. And skiing can be pretty hard on joints, and bones. I was skiing at week four. Let me tell you, two broken bone ends moving around, feels pretty wrong.</p>
<p>So yeah, donâ€™t do what I did. Donâ€™t break bones, and donâ€™t run or ski on them.</p>
<p>This happened almost ten years ago, and my foot still complains every now and then. I told thatâ€™s normal, and it wonâ€™t really stop. Just another reason to not break a bone.</p>
