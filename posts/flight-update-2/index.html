  <h1>Flight Update 2</h1>

  

  <p>Aug 21, 2023</p>
<p>I am on a plane, crazy I know. First I was scheduled for one flight, then I got bumped to another, but you read that (I hope). When I left off I was at gate B8 at BWI, things changed pretty quick after posting. <br>
I took off from (get it) the gate to use the restroom, when I got back, the flight info display was showing a different flight. What&hellip; I pulled out my phone and checked my boarding pass. My gate had changed to A14, halfway across the airport&hellip; I had plenty of time to get there, and I got there fine. <br>
I had to wait some more, as the plane at the gate hadn&rsquo;t left yet, thus mine couldn&rsquo;t pull in.</p>
<p>But that doesn&rsquo;t matter now, I&rsquo;m in the air. and on my way to RDU in NC. Then I&rsquo;ll be on to DEN.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll try to post this at RDU, don&rsquo;t know if I&rsquo;ll be able to, as I&rsquo;m writing this on my Mac vs my phone. Either way, I&rsquo;ll mark the post time of when I finished this. Check out the <a href="https://nthp.me/tagged/air-craziness">Air Craziness tag</a> on here for the whole thing.</p>
<p>P.S. My inflight entertainment is plane crash documentaries</p>
