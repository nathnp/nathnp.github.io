<p>I&rsquo;ve always loved a good vacation, who doesn&rsquo;t. But vacations take time. Time to plan. And time to take. Why not just take a day trip, you say. Why not to drive somewhere for a day, you ask. I live near DC, so a day trip is going down to DC for the whatever-ith time.</p>
<div id="idea" />
<h2 id="the-idea-idea">The Idea <a href="#idea">ðŸ”—</a></h2>
<p>The plan started with my friend texting me. Asking if I wanted to take a trip to Atlanta. Why? He wanted to get out of something<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>. The idea was a day trip, fly down first thing in the morning, see some things, and fly back after lunch. Now that&rsquo;s a day-cation.</p>
<div id="planing" />
<h2 id="planing-planing">Planing <a href="#planing">ðŸ”—</a></h2>
<p>So why Atlanta? Well, neither me, nor my friend have been there. And the flights were cheep. Like $50 round trip cheep. There&rsquo;s just one catch, we&rsquo;d be flying on Spirit. More on that later. Now we just needed something to do there. Easy, they have a big aquarium, and the Coca-Cola HQ. Buying the airline tickets was pretty straight forward. The Work of Coke tickets we would just buy at the door. The aquarium tickets on the other hand, oh man.</p>

<p>Buying the aquarium tickets was an absolute pain. No matter what I did, it would just give me an error. Didn&rsquo;t matter the card, time slot, or billing address, it just wouldn&rsquo;t work<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>. Then I had an idea. I fired up a VPN to California, and bought the tickets&hellip; I don&rsquo;t know why that worked. The problem continued. I couldn&rsquo;t add the ticket to Apple Wallet<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>. So I tried the same VPN to Cali trick. Boom I had my ticket. I forwarded the email to my friend so he could grab his<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup>.</p>

<p>I mostly fly on South West, so I didn&rsquo;t really know what to expect from Spirit. I didn&rsquo;t expect much, but damn did they fly under that. Here&rsquo;s a quick breakdown of the two.</p>

<p>Damn, that&rsquo;s not great. And that&rsquo;s not even the <a href="https://youtu.be/LPbm2tSssCQ?t=22">end of it</a>. The seats, oh god the seats.
I&rsquo;d describe South West&rsquo;s seats as, fine. They get the job done, they recline a bit, and the aren&rsquo;t painful over a long flight<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup>. Spirit&rsquo;s on the other hand&hellip; Our flight was 1H 50M. After about 90min, I wanted out, they were that bad. They also didn&rsquo;t recline<sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup>.</p>

<h3 id="atlanta-atlanta">Atlanta <a href="#atlanta">ðŸ”—</a></h3>
<p>We landed at ATL, and took a neat, but <a href="https://i.pinimg.com/originals/2b/ca/c1/2bcac10438ab9a950ac22ddf37b8b6e6.jpg">simple train</a> to the aquarium.</p>
<div id="aqu" />
<h4 id="the-aquarium-aqu">The Aquarium <a href="#aqu">ðŸ”—</a></h4>
<p>The aquarium was really cool, and quite <a href="https://i.pinimg.com/originals/35/0f/21/350f21c24d4cb73da2aab911f7758843.jpg">big</a>. Not much else to say, check out my <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/197704187@N04/albums/72177720310228473">flicker album</a> of the trip</p>
<div id="coke" />
<h4 id="world-of-coke-coke">World Of Coke <a href="#coke">ðŸ”—</a></h4>
<p>As a lover of Coca-Cola, I was super looking forward to World Of Coke. We started out by going into a waiting room, filled with tons of old <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/197704187@N04/53089257242/in/album-72177720310228473/">coke signs</a>. After being told they had a BBQ flavored soda in the tasting room. We moved into the main theater. They showed a three minute Coke ad, then in Wonka style, the theater screen moved up to reveal a entrance to the main floor<sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup>. There was a ton of stuff. A photo op with the <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/197704187@N04/53089256352/in/album-72177720310228473/">poler bear</a>, A smelling room, that I determined  wasn&rsquo;t working<sup id="fnref:8"><a href="#fn:8" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">8</a></sup>. The vault<sup id="fnref:9"><a href="#fn:9" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">9</a></sup>. And the main tasting room. Filled with Coke brand sodas from around the world. They also had what I was looking for. <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/197704187@N04/53090315338/in/album-72177720310228473/">Fresh Coke</a>. It was fantastic.</p>
<div id="lunch" />
<h4 id="lunch-lunch">Lunch <a href="#lunch">ðŸ”—</a></h4>
<p>After World Of Coke, we stopped off at the <a href="https://discoveratlanta.com/things-to-do/sports/college-football-hall-of-fame/">Chick-fil-A College Football Hall Of Fame</a> for a quick bite<sup id="fnref:10"><a href="#fn:10" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">10</a></sup>. Then walked around the Olympic Park for a bit.</p>
<div id="home" />
<h3 id="flight-home-home">Flight Home <a href="#home">ðŸ”—</a></h3>
<p>We took the train back to ATL, and waited for a couple hours in the TSA line. ATL was a neat airport, we took a little train like bus to our terminal<sup id="fnref:11"><a href="#fn:11" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">11</a></sup>. For some reason, Sprit wouldn&rsquo;t give us boarding codes on our phones, instead telling us to see a <a href="https://i.pinimg.com/originals/df/35/2f/df352f050a416b160aedf807dd02319a.jpg">gate agent</a>. They already had a paper boarding pass waiting for us. The flight back was exactly the same as the flight down, so just re-read that <a href="#flight">section</a>. There and back, just in time for dinner.</p>

<p>This Day-cation was fantastic, and one I highly recommend to my co-workers. As for my friend, he had to find a new excuse to not go to his thing. As we changed days to get the flight down from $80, to $50. We just couldn&rsquo;t not take a $50 round trip flight.</p>
