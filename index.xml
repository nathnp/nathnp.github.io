      <description>Rules The Object of the Game - The object of the game is to collect as few Points of Shame (see section 3) as possible. The contestant who collects the most Points of Shame at the end of a ski season earns the title of POS (Piece of Shit/Prince of Shame) for that season. After 10 years of play, the total number of seasonal POS are added together, and the player with the most seasonal POS becomes the POS of the Decade1.</description>

      <description>About Me I&amp;rsquo;m Nathan, I&amp;rsquo;m a computer nerd who loves to travel, and do many other things.
This is my blog. I mostly use this place as a place to post longer form content. Mostly of me rambling off about something. Posts here will mostly be about things Iâ€™m interested in, or whatever is on my mind.

      <description>Being More Stealthy With A Flipper Let&amp;rsquo;s be honest, most flipper users use the flipper to dick around. You know, pop Tesla charge covers, set off CVS alcohol announcements (Bonus points if you do it in a state CVS can&amp;rsquo;t sell alcohol in (Like Maryland)). You know, fun stuff. The Flipper is unfortunately recognizable (Thanks to dumpsters like TikTok). So, if we&amp;rsquo;re going to have some fun in a CVS, or a Tesla store, we need to be a bit sneaky.</description>

      <description>PaintBoy advance I&amp;rsquo;m not new to modded gameboys. I&amp;rsquo;ve put IPS screens in a DMG and an SP, and I built an all metal gameboy advance. Ive gotten the itch to build a custom GBA again after working on my girlfriend&amp;rsquo;s GBA, I just need an ideaâ€¦
This is what I&amp;rsquo;m thinking. This is made from painting the inside of a clear shell, allowing the supports to still be seen. This isn&amp;rsquo;t mine it&amp;rsquo;s a screenshot from this YouTube vid.</description>
