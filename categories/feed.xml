	  <title>New New Site</title>

	  <description><p>Nov 6, 2023</p>
<p>Welp, this was a pain.</p>
<p>Over the past few days, I have been working on moving my website. Why you might ask? Let&rsquo;s go over that.</p>
<p>For a while, I was hosting this site on <a href="https://blot.im">blot.im</a>. Blot basically takes a bunch of markdown files you send them, and turns them into a website. I was a big fan of this. Simple, easy, and flexible. However, I started running into problems.</p>
<p>When you send MD files to blot, blot will cache the files, and build a site out of them. Every now and then, that cache would get stuck. You could push new files, but they wouldn&rsquo;t appear on the visible site. The only way I had to force the cache to refresh, was to email the dev.</p>
<h2 id="moving-to-something-new">Moving to Something New</h2>
<p>After some thinking, I decided to go with a static site. I&rsquo;ll generate the site on my mac, then push it to a host. The first tool i tried out was <a href="https://www.11ty.dev">11ty</a> After a bunch of work, I got a super basic site up and running with <a href="https://www.11ty.dev">11ty</a> However, I didn&rsquo;t like it. <a href="https://www.11ty.dev">11ty</a> is written in Java Script, and I really don&rsquo;t like Java Script.</p>
<p>The next tool I tried was <a href="https://jekyllrb.com">Jekyll</a>. Jekyll looked way nicer to work with. There was just one tiny problem. Ruby 3.1.3 didn&rsquo;t want to compile on my mac. So that was out.</p>
<p>The tool that I went with (as you can see in the footer), is <a href="https://gohugo.io">Hugo</a>. Hugo, ships as a Go binary. This fixes the issue I had with Jekyll, and 11ty. Nothing to compile, and it&rsquo;s not Java Script. I&rsquo;m not going to go into how to use Hugo, has I&rsquo;m still learning it.</p>
<p>As for hosting, I&rsquo;m using <a href="https://pages.github.com">Github Pages</a>. All I have to do, is drop the built site into a folder. and push that to Github.</p>
<p>The best part of all of this. My hosting costs have gone from $4/month, to $0/month.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m still not done yet. The main thing remaining to to move all of my old posts over. That&rsquo;s going to take a bit. I&rsquo;ll get there though.</p>

	  <title>Stealth Flipper</title>

<p>Let&rsquo;s be honest, most flipper users use the flipper to dick around. You know, pop Tesla charge covers, set off CVS alcohol announcements (Bonus points if you do it in a state CVS can&rsquo;t sell alcohol in (Like Maryland)). You know, fun stuff. The Flipper is unfortunately recognizable (Thanks to dumpsters like TikTok). So, if we&rsquo;re going to have some fun in a CVS, or a Tesla store, we need to be a bit sneaky.</p>

<p>NOTE: This post doesn&rsquo;t cover Android, as I don&rsquo;t use that.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Don&rsquo;t use this post to do illegal stuff.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Flipper iOS app supports something super handy, Shortcuts. With an Apple Shortcuts, you can remotely tell the flipper to run a .sub file. Alright, so I can fire off a transmission form my phone, so what? I can just use the flipper app. He comes the best part of using a shortcut, you don&rsquo;t need to get your phone out.</p>
<p>The Apple watch Ultra, has a big orange button on the side<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>. This button (called the action button<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>) can be set to do a few things. Start a spot watch, start a work out, start a dive, etc. One of the options available, is to launch a shortcut. So, all you have to do, is make a basic shortcut<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>, that runs a sub file. Set the action button to run that. And Boom, you&rsquo;re ready to rock.</p>
<p>Have fun ;)</p>

<p>A while back, I upgraded the storage in my Steam Deck. Going from 512GB, to 2TB. The upgrade was so worth it. But, as a result, I had a 512GB SSD just sitting around.</p>
<p>After a while, I ended up ordering an NVME SSD enclosure.</p>
<p><img src="/fast-flashdrive/fig1.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>After chucking the SSD in there, and formatting it. I now have a little, fast as hell, USB drive. That I can also use if I need to image other NVME drives.</p>

	  <title>Turning Off Analytics For Now</title>
	  <link>https://example.org/posts/turning-off-analytics/</link>
	  <pubDate>Thu, 26 Oct 2023 22:51:17 -0500</pubDate>
	  <guid>https://example.org/posts/turning-off-analytics/</guid>
	  <description><p>Oct 26, 2023</p>
<p>For the past month, I&rsquo;ve been running analytics on both of my websites. The service I&rsquo;ve been using for this is <a href="https://plausible.io/">Plausible.io</a>. I went with them for a couple of reasons. Mainly, they didn&rsquo;t look hungry for personal data. I&rsquo;ve been enjoying them quite a lot. They have a good, very easy to use interface. That&rsquo;s also not over whelming. But, I&rsquo;m going to be turning analytics off, at least for now.</p>
<h2 id="why-i-started">Why I started</h2>
<p>I started using analytics to simply see how many people were going to my site. As well as from what countries. The UK, Poland, Romania, and Czechia, are just a few that have visited my main site. That&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;ve been enjoying the most.</p>
<h2 id="why-im-stopping-for-now">Why I&rsquo;m stopping, for now</h2>
<p>Price. That&rsquo;s it really. I have enjoyed Plausible, and still really like them. However I&rsquo;m coming up on the end of my free month. And will have to start paying $9/month. Now, I could switch to a different analytics provider. But, I&rsquo;m not big on a lot of the others I&rsquo;ve looked at. I don&rsquo;t want to be one of those sites, that vacuums up every possible bit of user data.</p>
<p>I do plan on firing analytics back up down the line though. Plausible is open source, and you can host it yourself. Something I will do at some point. (You can even run it on a Pi with some work).</p>
<p>So yeah. Plausible has been good and I like it. But it&rsquo;s not really worth $9/month to have them host it. At least for me.</p>

	  <title>The Secret Guest Network</title>
	  <link>https://example.org/posts/secret-guest-network/</link>
	  <pubDate>Sun, 22 Oct 2023 22:52:29 -0500</pubDate>
	  <guid>https://example.org/posts/secret-guest-network/</guid>
	  <description><p>Oct 22, 2023</p>
<p>Imagine this, you have some people over, and they want the password to your WiFi. You trust them, but not “you can be on my network” trust them. So you give them the guest network login. They get mad and leave, and now you&rsquo;re down a couple friends. But what if you could have a hidden guest network, that looks just like your main one, maybe that would let you keep some friends.</p>
<p>Ubiquity has rolled out support for PPSK (Private Pre Shared Keys). That let&rsquo;s you have multiple networks, behind one SSID. This is handy, as having too many SSIDs can hurt performance.</p>
<p>What PPKS does, is let you automatically put a host on a VLAN, depending on what password they use. For example, let&rsquo;s say we have a WiFi network called &ldquo;BullsEyeWiFi&rdquo;. We can set up PPSK so that anyone who uses the password &ldquo;GoodPassw0rd1!&rdquo;, will be put on VLAN 1. And anyone who uses the password &ldquo;Playground&rdquo;, will get put on VLAN 2.</p>
<p>Now that&rsquo;s a pretty business example. A more home user example would be: Having a segregated guest network, on the same SSID as your main one. This way, you can put your house guests on a guest network, without them having any idea. And thus, keeping them as friends.</p>
<p><img src="/guestnetwork/fig1.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Heres a good video from Cameron Gray Going over PPSK on UNiFi. And its downside (It doesn&rsquo;t work on WPA3 networks (That includes 6GHz networks)).</p>

<p>I am now on my way from RDU to DEN. <br>
After everyone getting off at RDU (all but 16), and a headcount was taken, we were able to move seats. I moved from the very back, to the very front. Hoping to make a speedy exit at DEN.</p>
<p>I mentioned at the end of my last post, that my in flight entertainment is a bunch of plane crash documentaries. I downloaded 16 20 - 40 min videos by Green Dot Aviation (fantastic channel). To help make sure the person next to me doesn&rsquo;t get nervous, I have the videos playing in the mini player in the corner on my mac.</p>
<p>First one I watched was about UPS flight 6, a cargo aircraft that had a cargo fire. <br>
The second one was Swissair flight 111, a flight that had a fire. <br>
The third was about BA 162, a flight that caught&hellip; fire&hellip;</p>
<p>No, not all of them are about fires, here&rsquo;s all the ones I downloaded</p>

<p>I am on a plane, crazy I know. First I was scheduled for one flight, then I got bumped to another, but you read that (I hope). When I left off I was at gate B8 at BWI, things changed pretty quick after posting. <br>
I took off from (get it) the gate to use the restroom, when I got back, the flight info display was showing a different flight. What&hellip; I pulled out my phone and checked my boarding pass. My gate had changed to A14, halfway across the airport&hellip; I had plenty of time to get there, and I got there fine. <br>
I had to wait some more, as the plane at the gate hadn&rsquo;t left yet, thus mine couldn&rsquo;t pull in.</p>
<p>But that doesn&rsquo;t matter now, I&rsquo;m in the air. and on my way to RDU in NC. Then I&rsquo;ll be on to DEN.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll try to post this at RDU, don&rsquo;t know if I&rsquo;ll be able to, as I&rsquo;m writing this on my Mac vs my phone. Either way, I&rsquo;ll mark the post time of when I finished this. Check out the <a href="https://nthp.me/tagged/air-craziness">Air Craziness tag</a> on here for the whole thing.</p>
<p>P.S. My inflight entertainment is plane crash documentaries</p>

<p>While waiting for my already delayed flight, I got a text saying that I had been rebooked to a new flight&hellip;<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> Later in the day. <br>
I was scheduled to fly from BWI at 13:40 to ATL, then to DEN. Now I&rsquo;m going from BWI at 15:25 to RDU to DEN&hellip; fun. And because I was rebooked, I&rsquo;ve been dumped to boarding group C out of&hellip; C. It&rsquo;s not all bad, while I&rsquo;ll be stopping in RDU, I&rsquo;m not changing planes. So I can get a better seat that way. BWI to RDU is only about 1H 5M. Hoping I don&rsquo;t get any more surprises on the flight.</p>

<p>With the shutting down of Crabland.social<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>, I&rsquo;ve migrated my account to a new server. <br>
I&rsquo;m using the same hosting provider <a href="https://masto.host">Masto.host</a>, just can&rsquo;t beat their pricing. My new server is a singer user one (not running in single user mode, because I think it looks ugly), <a href="https://mstdn.nthp.me">mstdn.nthp.me</a>. I&rsquo;m going to try and cut down the amount of domains I own (too many), so I&rsquo;m going to be tying more things to my main one (this one).</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s pretty much all I got, if you were following my old Mastodon account, you should be automatically following my new one <a href="https://fosstodon.org/@nthp">@nthp@fosstodon.org</a>. I&rsquo;m also posting this form an airport, so that&rsquo;s neat&hellip; my flight got delayed though&hellip;</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve always loved a good vacation, who doesn&rsquo;t. But vacations take time. Time to plan. And time to take. Why not just take a day trip, you say. Why not to drive somewhere for a day, you ask. I live near DC, so a day trip is going down to DC for the whatever-ith time.</p>
<div id="idea" />
<h2 id="the-idea-idea">The Idea <a href="#idea">🔗</a></h2>
<p>The plan started with my friend texting me. Asking if I wanted to take a trip to Atlanta. Why? He wanted to get out of something<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>. The idea was a day trip, fly down first thing in the morning, see some things, and fly back after lunch. Now that&rsquo;s a day-cation.</p>
<div id="planing" />
<h2 id="planing-planing">Planing <a href="#planing">🔗</a></h2>
<p>So why Atlanta? Well, neither me, nor my friend have been there. And the flights were cheep. Like $50 round trip cheep. There&rsquo;s just one catch, we&rsquo;d be flying on Spirit. More on that later. Now we just needed something to do there. Easy, they have a big aquarium, and the Coca-Cola HQ. Buying the airline tickets was pretty straight forward. The Work of Coke tickets we would just buy at the door. The aquarium tickets on the other hand, oh man.</p>
<div id="tickets" />
<h3 id="buying-atlanta-tickets-from-california-in-maryland-tickets">Buying Atlanta tickets, from California, In Maryland <a href="#tickets">🔗</a></h3>
<p>Buying the aquarium tickets was an absolute pain. No matter what I did, it would just give me an error. Didn&rsquo;t matter the card, time slot, or billing address, it just wouldn&rsquo;t work<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>. Then I had an idea. I fired up a VPN to California, and bought the tickets&hellip; I don&rsquo;t know why that worked. The problem continued. I couldn&rsquo;t add the ticket to Apple Wallet<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>. So I tried the same VPN to Cali trick. Boom I had my ticket. I forwarded the email to my friend so he could grab his<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup>.</p>

<p>I mostly fly on South West, so I didn&rsquo;t really know what to expect from Spirit. I didn&rsquo;t expect much, but damn did they fly under that. Here&rsquo;s a quick breakdown of the two.</p>

<p>Damn, that&rsquo;s not great. And that&rsquo;s not even the <a href="https://youtu.be/LPbm2tSssCQ?t=22">end of it</a>. The seats, oh god the seats.
I&rsquo;d describe South West&rsquo;s seats as, fine. They get the job done, they recline a bit, and the aren&rsquo;t painful over a long flight<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup>. Spirit&rsquo;s on the other hand&hellip; Our flight was 1H 50M. After about 90min, I wanted out, they were that bad. They also didn&rsquo;t recline<sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup>.</p>

<p>We landed at ATL, and took a neat, but <a href="https://i.pinimg.com/originals/2b/ca/c1/2bcac10438ab9a950ac22ddf37b8b6e6.jpg">simple train</a> to the aquarium.</p>

<p>The aquarium was really cool, and quite <a href="https://i.pinimg.com/originals/35/0f/21/350f21c24d4cb73da2aab911f7758843.jpg">big</a>. Not much else to say, check out my <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/197704187@N04/albums/72177720310228473">flicker album</a> of the trip</p>
<div id="coke" />
<h4 id="world-of-coke-coke">World Of Coke <a href="#coke">🔗</a></h4>
<p>As a lover of Coca-Cola, I was super looking forward to World Of Coke. We started out by going into a waiting room, filled with tons of old <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/197704187@N04/53089257242/in/album-72177720310228473/">coke signs</a>. After being told they had a BBQ flavored soda in the tasting room. We moved into the main theater. They showed a three minute Coke ad, then in Wonka style, the theater screen moved up to reveal a entrance to the main floor<sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup>. There was a ton of stuff. A photo op with the <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/197704187@N04/53089256352/in/album-72177720310228473/">poler bear</a>, A smelling room, that I determined  wasn&rsquo;t working<sup id="fnref:8"><a href="#fn:8" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">8</a></sup>. The vault<sup id="fnref:9"><a href="#fn:9" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">9</a></sup>. And the main tasting room. Filled with Coke brand sodas from around the world. They also had what I was looking for. <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/197704187@N04/53090315338/in/album-72177720310228473/">Fresh Coke</a>. It was fantastic.</p>

<p>After World Of Coke, we stopped off at the <a href="https://discoveratlanta.com/things-to-do/sports/college-football-hall-of-fame/">Chick-fil-A College Football Hall Of Fame</a> for a quick bite<sup id="fnref:10"><a href="#fn:10" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">10</a></sup>. Then walked around the Olympic Park for a bit.</p>

<h3 id="flight-home-home">Flight Home <a href="#home">🔗</a></h3>
<p>We took the train back to ATL, and waited for a couple hours in the TSA line. ATL was a neat airport, we took a little train like bus to our terminal<sup id="fnref:11"><a href="#fn:11" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">11</a></sup>. For some reason, Sprit wouldn&rsquo;t give us boarding codes on our phones, instead telling us to see a <a href="https://i.pinimg.com/originals/df/35/2f/df352f050a416b160aedf807dd02319a.jpg">gate agent</a>. They already had a paper boarding pass waiting for us. The flight back was exactly the same as the flight down, so just re-read that <a href="#flight">section</a>. There and back, just in time for dinner.</p>

<p>This Day-cation was fantastic, and one I highly recommend to my co-workers. As for my friend, he had to find a new excuse to not go to his thing. As we changed days to get the flight down from $80, to $50. We just couldn&rsquo;t not take a $50 round trip flight.</p>

<p>With the closing down of third party Reddit apps, a number of people are moving over to things like kbin. And that has me wondering, are the new users of kbin, going to try and turn it into Reddit.</p>
<p>This is something I’ve noticed over on Mastodon. When a large number a of new Mastodon users signed up, they very quickly started pushing for some new features. Those “new” features were just things that Twitter had, that Mastodon didn’t. It didn’t feel like they wanted to improve the Mastodon network. It felt like they wanted to turn it into what <strong>they</strong> were used to, instead of getting used to Mastodon.</p>
<p>We’ll see if this happens with kbin and other like it.</p>

<h1 id="paintboy-advance">PaintBoy advance</h1>
<p>I&rsquo;m not new to modded gameboys. I&rsquo;ve put IPS screens in a DMG and an SP, and I built an <a href="https://fosstodon.org/@Sulairris/106783968641330983">all metal gameboy advance</a>. Ive gotten the itch to build a custom GBA again after working on my girlfriend&rsquo;s GBA, I just need an idea…</p>
<hr>
<p><img src="/paintboy/fig1.png" alt=""></p>
<p>This is what I&rsquo;m thinking. This is made from painting the inside of a clear shell, allowing the supports to still be seen. This isn&rsquo;t mine it&rsquo;s a screenshot from <a href="https://youtu.be/XF_DDf9N1hc">this YouTube vid</a>. I&rsquo;m not going to build the full thing yet, just see if I can make the shell myself.</p>
<p>I ordered a clear replacement shell that&rsquo;s been pre-modded to take an IPS display, just need to buy some spray paint.</p>
<hr>
<p>Many days later thanks to USPS, the shell came in the mail. It&rsquo;s a clear retrosix shell and its one of the better ones I&rsquo;ve seen</p>
<p><img src="/paintboy/fig2.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>The next thing I needed was some spray paint, so I grabbed my super gameboy, jumped in my car and headed up to the home depot. After looking over the spray paint aisle, they didn&rsquo;t really have what I was looking for, but I got something close. Oddly, <a href="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Btv1OD_CUAAICrF?format=jpg&amp;name=medium">my home state</a> Maryalnd requires you to be at least 18 to buy spray paint. Good thing i&rsquo;m 25.</p>
<p>This is really my first time spray painting anything, but I have watched some modding vids that go over it. After taping up the outside, cracking the garage door, I got to work. I put down one layer, then another, then another, and waited. After peeling the tape off, it came out pretty good. Some over spray on the edges, but for a first time ensnarement, it went pretty well. I&rsquo;ll build something in this down the line.</p>
